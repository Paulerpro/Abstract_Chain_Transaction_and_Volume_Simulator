# 🔁 Abstract Chain Transaction & Volume Simulator

A lightweight CLI-based Python bot designed to simulate **on-chain wallet transactions** and optionally **DEX trading volume** on [Abstract Chain](https://api.mainnet.abs.xyz) — an Ethereum Layer 2 network. Built for developers, token teams, and testers looking to replicate realistic activity on-chain.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Simulates randomized or scheduled **wallet-to-wallet transactions**
- 💸 Automatically funds wallets if balances fall below threshold
- 🧪 (Optional) Simulates **DEX-like trading volume** for visibility
- 🔐 Secure `.env`-based private key handling
- 🧵 Custom **RPC support** for Abstract Chain or any EVM-compatible network
- ⚙️ Clean CLI-based execution (Linux/Mac-friendly)

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- On-chain activity simulation for token visibility
- Testing on-chain volume metrics
- Seeding wallets in test environments
- Generating heatmaps on block explorers

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- `dotenv`, `logging`, and standard libs

---

## 🔧 Setup

1. **Clone this repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/abstract-volume-bot.git
cd abstract-volume-bot
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Create `.env` file**

```env
PRIVATE_KEYS=comma,separated,list,of,privatekeys
FUNDER_KEY=your_main_wallet_private_key
RPC_URL=https://your-abstract-chain-rpc-url
```

4. **Run the bot**

```bash
python simulator.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can modify the following constants in the script:

```python
THRESHOLD = web3.to_wei(0.001, 'ether')   # Min balance before funding
TOP_UP_AMOUNT = web3.to_wei(0.005, 'ether')
GAS_LIMIT = 21000
```
